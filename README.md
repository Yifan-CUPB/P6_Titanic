# P6 Titanic Data Visualization
## Introduction
Finally I chose the simplest data visualization, exploring Titanic survivability. In this data visualization, I split the dataset into four datasets at first, then visualize them with d3.
## Topics
The topics I'm going to talk about (and visualize) are gender, age, class and gender & class. These four topics involve most attracting and worth-investigating points of society and humanity. Here are the results of my data visualization.
1. Survival rate by class: According to my research, the survival rate of 1st class is higher than 3rd class.
2. Survival rate by age: All the children within 0-10 years old group survived, and most in 0-15 survived
3. Survival rate by gender: Females on Titanic survived much more than males.
4. Survival rate by class and gender: 1st class females have the highest survivability, while 3rd males have the lowest.
## Design
In this visualization, I applied these kings of features to better perform my results and thinking.
* Type pf my charts: bar chart. Almost all the data items in this dataset are catagorical classifications, which means bar chart is the best.
* layout status: Survivability is rated by zero and one, and stacked bar chart can appropriately illustrate this status.
* Legend position: Duet to the situation that bar charts are same for all the categories, I moved legend to the right position.
* Visual encodings: X-axis means various categories, while Y-axis means ratio. Survivability is classified by sequential colors, to avoid visual fatigue.
## Feedback
1. Please add more descriptive sentence for this data visualization, for further illustration.
2. The color applied in charts could be more attractive. Thin shades are over-utilized.
3. If possible, any ainimation for dunamic change (if exists) is better.
